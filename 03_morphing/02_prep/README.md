files for preparing morphing input files   
###############  
.pdb files: structure files of the Open, Closed and (estimated) intermediate structures  
.in: files: input files for creating morphing simulation input file  
.mor files: morphing simulations input files for each subpathway  
.grotop files: triple-basin parameter files for each pathway (identical to those used for later MD runs)
