This directory contains files for plotting 2D pmf in the LID/NMP angle space for the sampling simulations with the final mixing parameters (pmfs were already calculated in the "04_md_runs" section):  

pmf_2d_genesis_matplotlib.tcl: script for converting GENESIS pmf output file format to a matplotlib format  
matplotlib_nmp_lid_temp.py: script for plotting 2D pmf  
xxx_x.txt, xxx_y.txt: pmf grid points  
xxx.pmf: files containing pmf at each grid point
