The repository contains the following dorectories: 

00_important_files  
01_model  
02_motion_tree  
03_morphing  
04_md_runs  
05_mbar  
06_sampling_analysis  

* Most important files were placed in "00_important_files", whereas more specific data for each part was placed in 01~06 directories.
README files were placed under each directory to describe its content. 
Due to the large number of simulation rounds in some cases, only smaple files were deposited. 
Trajectory files were not included due to their large size.
